## Budget Management



## Introduction
The Budget Management App helps to record and categorize, monitor and control expenses. With it's user-friendly interface users can easily 
add a new expense, find, edit and delete existing expense from the list. And also this app has filter which categorize expenses by date.

## TECHNOLOGY USED

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## APPROACH

First of all I started from setting up an express to make all CRUD work. Once I had all CRUD routes set up I jumped into Bootstap and ejs and started designing the app


## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS/STRETCH GOALS

* For some reason after rendering the date shows a day behind in the browser. Only to converting to ISO format, it shows correct date.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

* clone the repository into a local file
* 
* open the index.html file and enjoy

### MVP
* As a user, I want to see all my expenses on one list
* As a user, I want to be able to add, edit and delete an item in the list
* As a user, I want to see my total expense, income and balance seperately on home page
